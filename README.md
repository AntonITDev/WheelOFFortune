# WheelOFFortune
It is possible to add a wheel segment, rotation occurs randomly.

Currently there is the following functionality:
* Adding several segments that are located along the wheel (limit 8).
* Cleaning the entire wheel;
* Rotation (occurs in a random direction, in N-degrees)

Initial view of the wheel:
